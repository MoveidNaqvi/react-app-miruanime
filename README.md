# MIRUANIME

This project is called MiruAnime (みるアニメ) which translates to WatchAnime. It uses the Jikan API to serve anime data. The website displays anime based on categories such as top, upcoming, airing etc. Users can also search an anime using the search bar. Upon clicking on an 'anime-card' more detailed information is provided about the anime. From here users can also click the heart icon to add the anime to the favourite page. The anime is then persisted to local storage meaning it will not be deleted even if the user closes the website and comes back. Users can remove a favourite anime from the favourite page by clicking the x icon. The website is also mobile-friendly and will scale accordingly. More features will be added in the future.
