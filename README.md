# MIRUANIME

This project is called MiruAnime (みるアニメ) which translates to WatchAnime. It uses the Jikan API to serve anime data. The website displays anime based on categories such as top, upcoming, airing etc. Users can also search an anime using the search bar. Upon clicking on an 'anime-card' more detailed information is provided. Users are also able to add anime to a favourite page. After creating an account or authenticating with Google users can add an anime as a favourite by clicking the heart icon in the anime-card. Users can remove a favourite anime from the favourite page by clicking the x icon. The website is also mobile-friendly and will scale accordingly.
